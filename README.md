  ## Description

  This project involves building an API for a social network web application <br>
  where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts & create a friend list. <br>
  This project utilizes Express.js for routing, MongoDB for the database & the Mongoose ODM. <br>
  The goal is to create a scalable API that can handle large amounts of unstructured data <br>
  typically found in social networking platforms. 
  
  ## Usage 

   ･ clone the repository to your local machine <br>
   ･ install dependencies using `npm install` <br>
   ･ start the server by running `npm start` <br>
   ･ use a tool like Insomnia to interact with the API endpoints <br>
   ･ refer to the walkthrough video for a demonstration of the API's functionality

  ## Project Motivation

  This project provided a hands-on experience in building an API <br>
  for a social network web application using NoSQL database technology. <br>
  Working on this project gained understanding in the importance of using NoSQL databases <br>
  like MongoDB for handling large amounts of unstructured data commonly found in social networking platforms. <br>
  This project allowed practicing skills in API development, routing with Express.js, <br>
  & database management with MongoDB & Mongoose. 
  
  ## What Was Learned

  ･ understanding the importance of using a NoSQL databases like MongoDB <br>
  &nbsp; for handling unstructured data in a social network application

  ･ implementing RESTful API endpoints using Express.js for routing

  ･ creating & managing data models using Mongoose ODM in Node.js

  ･ building CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for interacting with the database

  ･ handling user authentication & authorization for secure access to the API

  ･ testing API endpoints using tools like Insomnia

  ･ practicing best practices for file structure

  ･ working on a project that simulates real-world application development tasks
